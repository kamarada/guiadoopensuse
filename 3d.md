# 15. Graphics Drivers

Note that there's no need to install the below non-free video drivers, if the free drivers used by default work for your needs.

## 15.1 Nvidia

This section describes two different ways of installing the proprietary Nvidia graphics driver, either using 1-click installation or using the terminal.

### 15.1.1 Install the Nvidia Driver with 1-Click Installation

Click on the button corresponding to your Nvidia graphics card to install the driver with 1-click install.

This driver covers any Nvidia graphics card from Geforce 400 series and later.

This driver covers any Nvidia graphics card newer than 2008 or so. Including GeForce 8, GeForce 100-, 200- and 300-series.

{% include ymp.html icon="nvidia-gf8" link="http://opensuse-community.org/nvidia_gf8.ymp" %}

{% include ymp.html icon="nvidia-gf6" link="http://opensuse-community.org/nvidia-gf6_gf7.ymp" %}

Afterwards reboot the computer.

### 15.1.2 Install the Nvidia Driver in the Terminal

You can install the Nvidia driver in the terminal. **By using this method you don't need to know your graphics card model or series**.

First add the repository:

<div class="clroot">zypper addrepo -f http://download.nvidia.com/opensuse/leap/42.1 nvidia</div>

The following command should automatically install the correct driver for your card:

<div class="clroot">zypper install-new-recommends</div>

When installation is done reboot the computer.

## 15.2 ATI/AMD

Click the button to launch 1-click install of the proprietary ATI driver for Radeon HD5000 cards or later.

## 15.3 Intel

The 3D drivers for Intel graphics cards are free software, and can therefore be included in openSUSE out of the box. No additional installation or configuration is needed.
