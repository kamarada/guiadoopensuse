# 15. Graphics Drivers

Note that there's no need to install the below non-free video drivers, if the free drivers used by default work for your needs.

## 15.1 Nvidia

This section describes two different ways of installing the proprietary Nvidia graphics driver, either using 1-click installation or using the terminal.

### 15.1.1 Install the Nvidia Driver with 1-Click Installation

Click on the button corresponding to your Nvidia graphics card to install the driver with 1-click install.

One click for **Geforce 600 series and later**. [See supported products](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/145182/en-us).

{% include ymp.html icon="nvidia" link="http://opensuse-community.org/nvidia_G05.ymp" %}

One click for **Geforce 400 series and later**. [See supported products](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/142567/en-us).

{% include ymp.html icon="nvidia" link="http://opensuse-community.org/nvidia_G04.ymp" %}

One click for **Geforce 8xxx and later**. [See supported products](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/135161/en-us).

{% include ymp.html icon="nvidia" link="http://opensuse-community.org/nvidia_G03.ymp" %}

Afterwards reboot the computer.

### 15.1.2 Install the Nvidia Driver in the Terminal

You can install the Nvidia driver in the terminal. **By using this method you don't need to know your graphics card model or series**.

First add the repository:

<div class="clroot">zypper addrepo -f http://download.nvidia.com/opensuse/leap/15.1 nvidia</div>

The following command should automatically install the correct driver for your card:

<div class="clroot">zypper install-new-recommends --repo https://download.nvidia.com/opensuse/leap/15.1</div>

When installation is done reboot the computer.

## 15.2 ATI/AMD

The free software drivers included by default should work very well for most.

## 15.3 Intel

The 3D drivers for Intel graphics cards are free software, and can therefore be included in openSUSE out of the box. No additional installation or configuration is needed.
